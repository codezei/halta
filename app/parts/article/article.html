                CUMBERLAND, MD – The ACRP Ride4DEI team has been making steady progress as they completed day three of their journey from Pittsburgh, PA to Washington, D.C., in support of promoting diversity at all levels of clinical trials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sergio Armani, ACRP Ride4DEI Creator and EVP of Business Development at Helios Clinical Research, anticipates potential challenges on day four. He mentions the forecast of bad weather and the possibility of encountering muddy conditions during their 65-mile segment. Adding to the hurdles is a rockslide, which forces the team to push their bikes up a steep one-mile mountain in Paw Paw, West Virginia since the tunnel is closed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the obstacles, the team remains in good spirits, finding nourishment at an Italian restaurant to fuel themselves for the journey ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joining Armani on the ride this year are David Morin, MD, FACP, CPI, FACRP, Director of Research at Holston Medical Group, and Scott Chatterton, Senior Director of Business Development at Javara Research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now in its third year, the ride continues to raise funds and generate discussions surrounding the importance of diversity in clinical trials. Sponsors like Velocity, represented by Paul Evans, President and CEO, express their support for the cause, recognizing that inclusion is crucial for the success of clinical trials.
            </p>

                Armani expresses gratitude towards supporters, both for their financial contributions and their encouragement along the way. The team finds inspiration in the text messages and LinkedIn messages they receive during the ride.
            </p>
            <p>
                The annual fundraiser provides scholarships to clinical researchers from diverse backgrounds, supporting their professional growth and development. This year's ride is scheduled to conclude on May 20 near ACRP headquarters in Washington, D.C., after covering a total of 365 miles from Pittsburgh.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, Armani and the team are considering some changes for the 2024 ride. They contemplate altering the route, possibly starting from New York City and heading towards Albany, NY, then either Buffalo, NY, or Montreal, Canada. Additionally, they hope to recruit more female riders and further diversify their team.
