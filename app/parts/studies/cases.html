                        For their new drug targeting a rare genetic disorder, [Pharma Company D] needed to recruit a
                        specific patient demographic which was spread thin globally and challenging to reach.

                        <b>Our Solution:</b><br>
                        We employed a multi-pronged digital strategy combining geo-targeted online ads, specialized
                        social media groups, and collaborations with rare disease advocacy platforms. Our proprietary
                        algorithm also screened online patient communities to identify potential candidates.

                        the initial phase of the clinical trial and ensuring a diverse and appropriate group of

                        <b>The Challenge:</b><br>
                        Pharma Company E] was launching a trial in regions where cultural barriers and lack of awareness
                        about clinical trials made patient recruitment difficult.

                    <p class="case__text">
                        <b>Our Solution:</b><br>
                        Recognizing the power of community influencers, we initiated a campaign where regional
                        micro-influencers educated their followers about the benefits and safety of clinical trials.
                        Parallelly, we developed multilingual digital platforms to answer queries, address concerns, and
                        simplify the registration process for interested candidates.

                        <b>The Result:</b><br>
                        The influencer campaign reached over a million individuals, leading to a 50% surge in patient
                        inquiries. Eventually, patient recruitment goals were met two months ahead of schedule.

                        <b>The Challenge:</b><br>
                        While [Pharma Company F] could initially recruit patients for their long-term study on an
                        arthritis drug, they struggled with a high drop-out rate, endangering the trial's validity.

                    <p class="case__text">
                        <b>Our Solution:</b><br>
                        We implemented a digital patient engagement system, offering virtual check-ins, reminders, and
                        an interactive platform where patients could log their experiences and get immediate feedback.
                        We also launched a monthly newsletter highlighting the trial's progress and importance, ensuring
                        patients felt involved and valued.

                        The drop-out rate plummeted by 70%. The trial not only retained its participants but also
                        garnered a community of engaged patients eager to share their positive experiences, promoting
                        further recruitment.
